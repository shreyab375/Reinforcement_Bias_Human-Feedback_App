   Find the existing page you want to edit and click on it to open it for modification.

3. **Follow the Same Creation Steps**:  
   The process for modifying a page is the same as creating a new one. Here’s a breakdown:  
   - **Location**: Choose where the page should be located (e.g., under ""Services"").  
   - **Page Title**: Update or add a clear and concise title.  
   - **Page Content**: Edit the body text, ensuring it follows the structured prompt provided in Document 1 (e.g., context, objectives, links, image, CTA, keywords, etc.).  
   - **Media**: Add or update images to reduce bounce rates.  
   - **Translation**: Use the (+) button next to language flags to create a duplicate for translation (via GPT).  

4. **Save as Draft**:  
   After making changes, save the page as a draft to maintain control over the content before publishing.  

5. **Publish After Review**:  
   Once you’ve reviewed the changes, click the publish button to make the updated page live on **dtsc.be**.  

**Note**: Ensure you have the appropriate role (Contributor, Author, Editor, or Administrator) to modify pages, as mentioned in Document 1.  

The information is directly derived from **Document 1**, which outlines both page creation and modification processes.",232
q2_24,q2,24,How can I modify a page on dtsc.be?,Deepseek,"Based on the provided context from Document 1, here’s how you can modify a page on **dtsc.be**:

### Steps to Modify an Existing Page:
1. **Access Permissions**: Ensure you have the required role (Contributor, Author, Editor, or Administrator). The ""Subscriber"" role does not have editing permissions.  
2. **Navigate to the Page**:  
   - Go to the site’s admin console and open the **“Pages”** tab.  
   - Locate the page you want to modify.  
3. **Edit the Content**:  
   - Update the page’s title, text, or structure as needed. Follow the same content guidelines as for creation (e.g., context, objectives, keywords, SEO hierarchy, links, and call-to-action).  
   - Use the provided HTML template if applicable.  
4. **Media/Images**: Add or replace images to reduce bounce rates.  
5. **Multilingual Updates (if needed)**:  
   - Use the (+) button next to flags to create a translated version. Verify URLs in translations, as errors may occur.  
6. **Save as Draft**: Always save changes as a draft first for review.  
7. **Publish**: After review, click the publish button to update the page live on **dtsc.be**.  

### Key Notes:  
- The process mirrors creating a new page (Document 1 explicitly states: *""Modifier une page existante: Même procédure que pour la création""*).  
- Ensure adherence to SEO and structural guidelines (e.g., H1/H2 tags, word count).  

If you lack the required permissions, contact an administrator (e.g., Sylvain Grondal or David Budin, as per the documents).
